GHS_MST
===============

GHS_MST is an implementation of "Gallager Humblet Spira" Algorithm for distributed minimum spanning tree.<br>
The implementation is done in Java language using java threads to simulate the nodes.
<br><br>
Details regarding the algorithm can be found in the paper: <i>"A Distributed Algorithm for Minimum-Weight Spanning Trees" by "R. G. GALLAGER, P. A. HUMBLET, and P. M. SPIRA"</i>.<br><br>
The implementation is really simple & the project can be imported to eclipse. We have even packed some test cases with junit support.
